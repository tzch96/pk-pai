## Final project: Sapiens - An e-learning web application

### Project description
The goal of this app is to offer short courses on various topics. The topics are broken into four major parts - theory, flashcards, tasks and tests (consisting of tasks). Theory consists of HTML-based pages about the subject. Flashcards are two-sided cards with short information on a single term or concept. Tasks are currently in the form of a question and a text answer. The answer entered by the user is checked against the answer field in the database. Tests are comprised of a number of tasks (either new ones, or ones already 'belonging' to a lesson). The percentage of correct answers on tests is used as the measure of lesson and course completion.

### How to run
The app is designed to work with an AMP (Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack. If you have your stack set up, just put the contents of this repo in your Apache DocumentRoot folder and access it via localhost.
